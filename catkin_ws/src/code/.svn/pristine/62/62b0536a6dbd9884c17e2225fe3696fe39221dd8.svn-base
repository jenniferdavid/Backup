/**
   \file gfx.hpp

   Simplified GUI wrapper around GTK, GDK, and Cairo.  By using this
   wrapper, you can easily create a custom graphical output with a few
   buttons that will be displayed along the bottom of the GUI window.
   Processing mouse events like clicking and dragging is also kept
   very simple.

   The basic approach is that you register various callback functions
   via function pointers.  Thus, for each custom button, you specify a
   separate function to gfx::add_button.  This function will
   get called when the corresponding button is clicked.  Similarly,
   your custom mouse callback is specified as a function pointer to
   the gfx::main.  Your custom drawing function gets
   registered there as well.  Various functions are provided so that
   you can draw shapes on the GUI.

   The gfx::main function gets called as the last action in
   your program.  it sets up GTK for you and enters its event handling
   loop.
