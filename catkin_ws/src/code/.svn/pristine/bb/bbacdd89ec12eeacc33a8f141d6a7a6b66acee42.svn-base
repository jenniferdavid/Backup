You need a C compiler, CMake, and GTK+ for the demo program.  You also
need Doxygen if you intend to create documentation. The rest should be
straightforward.

    git clone https://github.com/poftwaresatent/estar2.git
    cd estar2
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./gestar

To create the documentation, go to the top-level directory and...

    doxygen Doxyfile

...then open html/index.html in a browser.
