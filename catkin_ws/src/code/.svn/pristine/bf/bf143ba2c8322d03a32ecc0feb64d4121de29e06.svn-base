Cargo-ANTS Path Adaptor
=================

CHOMP implementation is based on source code from [trychomp][]

Build and Run GUI:
-------
You need [CMake][], [Eigen][] v3, and [GTK+][] v2.

    git clone https://github.com/j3sq/ROS-CHOMP.git chomp
    mkdir chomp/build
    cd chomp/build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./chomp-shell

Usage:
------
```c++
void generatePath(VectorXd const &qs, VectorXd const &qe, VectorXd &xi, MatrixXd const &obs);
```
* qs : Start point (x,y) as a 2x1 vector.
* qe : End point (x,y) as a 2x1 vector.
* xi : Generated chomp trajectory points (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,...,x<sub>N</sub>,y<sub>N</sub>) as 2*Nx1 vector. N is currently fixed to 20.
* obs : A matrix of disk like obstacles of size Kx3. Each row is (x,y,R) of the obstacle.

Notes:
* If the function is called with a non empty trajectory xi, the function will use the provided trajectory as an initial guess for the chomp algorithm.
* demo/minimal_program.cpp shows a basic example of using chomp


ROS Support:
------------
You need [Cargo-ANTS][] for messages definitions. Place the project folder inside
 (path_to_ros_workspace)/src and then build by executing catkin_make
 For testing:

    roscore
    //on a separate terminal
    rosrun cargo_ants_path_adaptor path_adaptor
    //on a separate terminal
    rostopic echo /trajectory  
    //on a separate terminal. Replace x0,y0 and x1,y1 (below) by coordinates of start and end points respectively.
    rostopic pub -1 /path_planner cargo_ants_msgs/Path '{mode: 0, container: name , goals: [{gx: x0, gy: y0, gth: 0, dr: 0, dth: 0},{gx: x1, gy: g1, gth: 0, dr: 0, dth: 0}]}'



As the name implies, this is based on [CHOMP][].
