NOTE: terminology has changed since this early draft, but the general idea
still holds.  In particular, route_planner was renamed to task_scheduler (or
maybe by now something else), and not everything may have detailed status
feedback information.

--------------------

One centralized Route Planner for all the vehicles on the site:

/route_request         -> route_planner  -> /route
/route_request_status <-                <-  /route_status


Each vehicle is identified by name (denoted $VN below) and has the following motion generation stack.  Note that, in the publish and subscribe calls, the /$VN/ portion
of the topic name must be omitted so that we can rely on ROS namespace mechanisms.
Also, at the lowest level (probably even before vehicle control) we will not use ROS
messages anymore anyway, as the industry partners have their own systems there.

/route         -> path_planner  -> /$VN/path
/route_status <-               <-  /$VN/path_status

/$VN/path         -> path_adaptor  -> /$VN/trajectory
/$VN/path_status <-               <-  /$VN/trajectory_status

/$VN/trajectory         -> vehicle_control  -> ...
/$VN/trajectory_status <-                  <-  ...


We also need to sketch some kind of handshake process, for trucks entering or leaving the site.
