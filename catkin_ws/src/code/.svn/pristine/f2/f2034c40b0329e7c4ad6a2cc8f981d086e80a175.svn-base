Cargo-ANTs architecture terminologies
=====================================

Only from a motion generation point of view (for now). Frankly, I (Rolo) don't think it makes much sense to spend too much time deliberating conceptual architectures: we will discover what works during development, and it will be fairly close to established hybrid architectures in robotics.

Functional architecture to/from SW architecture
-----------------------------------------------

Navigation layer terms (roughly left to right):

* map database
** permanent static
** transient global
** transient local
* host positioning
* object route prediction
* host route prediction
* spatial and importance filtering (pending discussion IRI/Volvo)

Application layer terms (strictly top to bottom):

* site plan - gives the task
** should not be called "plan" and should use plural tasks
** ROS package *cargo_ants_operator_interface* (to be drafted)
* route generation & management (should be called task scheduling or so, this may have made it into the deliverables)
** ROS package *cargo_ants_task_scheduler*
* path generator & management
** should use consistent -ator or -ation throughout
** ROS package *cargo_ants_path_planner*
* situation assessment
** not sure what was meant by this...
** ROS package *cargo_ants_path_adaptor*
* IWI manager
** fold this into some other module (path adaptor and/or vehicle_control)
* vehicle control
** no corresponding ROS package (for now at least)
