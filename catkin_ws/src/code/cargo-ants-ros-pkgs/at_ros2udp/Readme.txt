This package subscribes to an existing trajectory in the format ReferenceTrajectory.msg and encodes it into udp packets with doubles and sends it to the Autobox on the AT side with a specific IP and port address. As per AT requirements, each UDP packet is now = 20 points * 8 (doubles) * 9 parameters (x,y,th,xd,yd,thd,xxd,yyd,thdd) = 1440 bytes each. This may vary according to the trajectory points required by the AT.
